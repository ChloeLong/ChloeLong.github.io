            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                <b>I am proficient with HTML/CSS, Javascript, React, Bootstrap 5, Node, Python, C#, SQL, NoSQL, Azure, and many more.</b> 
                As a full-stack developer, I have worked in many modern languages, frameworks, and libraries. I have experience supporting software and developing new solutions, which has trained 
                my problem-solving skills and my ability to learn new things fast. I work incredibly well on teams and solo, and I pride myself on my communication skills. You can find the code 
                from some of my projects on my GitHub page linked above. I am currently studying for my Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Certification, and learning Spanish!

                <h3>Pupperino Discord Bot</h3>
                <h4>Python / Node JS</h4>
                <p>
                    Pupperino is a multipurpose discord bot I made mainly to give users easy access to free games on the Epic Games store, these change often so having a way to check the games
                    on a regular basis is ideal. Pupperino can also access current sales on the Steam Store. This is done by accessing APIs that Epic and Steam both use to list these deals. I am
                    currently rewriting Pupperino in Javascript to practice Javascript, and to add more features.

                <h4>Unity 2D / C#</h4>
                <p>
                    Project F.A.T.E. is a passion project of myself who is doing the programming, and TheArtistJulian who is doing the art, based on a comic Julian made, we are working 
                    together to turn into a full story driven game. The code can not be found on my GitHub to protect the security of the project but I am happy to talk in depth about the solutions we 
                    have come up with to bring the game to life.
